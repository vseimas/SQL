--- uses the windows functions to FIRST, add a count of all of the records
  --- sorts by descending so that the most recent record is assigned a 1
  --- partition by says what is counted segregated (id so person) and then order by (how you're determing what receives a 1, 2, etc.)

--- add record numbers in a CTE then do a filter/calculate by that number afterwards - equals 1 means only show me the most recent for everyone - nicer way than using max like originally attempted
