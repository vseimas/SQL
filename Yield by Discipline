-- Yeild - First-Year Students enrolled/admitted  % by discipline

--- before complting this query, you need to determine if there are any students incorrectly coded (applied in a different term than the Fall they enrolled in).
--- to do this - run query A to determine what students have different admission records
--- then take those ids and run query B to figure out which students need to be manually added to the population in the adms CTE

/* Query A
 select id, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME

Query B
select *
